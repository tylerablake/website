NativeScript is how you build cross-platform, native iOS and Android apps with JavaScript, but what does that really mean?
<!--more-->

It means:

- You get to use Angular, TypeScript or JavaScript
- You get truly native UI performance
- You can reuse skills and code from your web projects
- You also get 100% access to native device API's via JavaScript
- You get reuse of packages from npm, CocoaPods, and Gradle
- It is open source
- It is backed by Progress
