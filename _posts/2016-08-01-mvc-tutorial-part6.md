---

This is a tutorial series showing how to get up and running with MVC. 
Now that we have started a little bit of refactoring in the last section, lets stop and talk about refactoring.
Specifically we'll talk about what refactoring is, and different methodologies and techniques for refactoring.

##### What is a refactoring?
* To keep it simple, Refactoring is the process of visiting existing code and improving it.. simple as that. For example whether you are improving it for readability for newer team members, or improving performance of code, both are refactoring.

##### Types of Refactoring
* Comprehension - This is when you are refactoring code because it is hard to read or understand.
* Prepatory - This is when you are determining on the best way to implement a feature before marking it as "complete".
* Planned - Team refactoring, this **shouldn't** happen, refactoring should be continuously done by each developer, so group refactoring shouldn't be needed.

#### Refactoring Triggers and Matching Type of Refactoring
* If you hear or think one of the following when reviewing code then you should probably refactor:

* "I don't understand..." - Comprehension Refactoring
* "We should have done it this way" - Prepatory Refactoring
* To be continued...

##### Refactoring Methodologies/Principles
* Litter Pick Up Refactoring or Boy Scout Principle - Leave code better than when you found it.
* To be continued...


##### Notes/References
* Here are a few references for you to look into for more refactoring knowledge.
* Martin Fowler - Refactoring (book)
* To be continued...
